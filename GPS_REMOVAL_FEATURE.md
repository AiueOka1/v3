# GPS Device Removal Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Feature Added: Remove GPS Device from Dogs

You can now remove GPS devices from dogs through multiple interfaces in your PawTech app.

## 🔧 How GPS Removal Works

### 1. **Dog List (Main Interface)**
- **Location**: Dogs tab → Dog list items
- **Visual**: GPS badge now shows a small ❌ icon when clicked
- **Action**: Tap the green "GPS" badge to remove the device
- **Confirmation**: Shows confirmation dialog before removal

### 2. **Dog Details Screen**
- **Location**: Dogs tab → Select a dog → Dog details
- **Visual**: GPS Device row shows device ID with remove icon
- **Action**: Tap the red delete icon next to the device ID
- **Confirmation**: Shows detailed confirmation with dog name and device ID

### 3. **Debug Screen (Advanced)**
- **Location**: Profile tab → Device Assignment Debug
- **Visual**: Each dog with GPS shows a red delete icon
- **Action**: Direct removal with confirmation
- **Usage**: For troubleshooting and bulk management

## 🔄 What Happens When You Remove GPS

1. **Realtime Database**: Removes `dogId` field from the device
2. **Firestore**: Removes `deviceId` field from the dog document  
3. **Local State**: Updates the dog object immediately
4. **UI Update**: GPS badge changes from green "GPS" to blue "Add GPS"
5. **Tracking**: Location tracking stops for that dog

## 🎯 User Experience

### Before Removal:
```
[🐕 Buddy] [🟢 GPS ❌] [🔶 Medical]
```

### After Removal:
```
[🐕 Buddy] [🔵 Add GPS] [🔶 Medical]
```
